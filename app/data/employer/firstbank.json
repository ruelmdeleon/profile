Although it was a language I had only just heard of, I dove in, and rebuilt the Intranet from scratch, with a dynamic content-management system that allowed for quick scaling for new departments, and for admin to build out schedules, share documents, and provide announcements. A fan favorite was a photo-sharing module created that helped engage our various remote locations, and fostered a sense of community and camaraderie among the employees."}],
